# ðŸš€ TREW Component Starter

## Description
A Typescript-React-Express-Webpack web component package starter, allowing you to quickly start creating a react component package. This starter includes a web application that contains the component, meaning that it can be developed, tested, and demoed all in one place.

This is based off of [TREW Starter](https://github.com/samhuk/trew-starter).

Aspects:
* **Typescript** for *all* files
* **React** for UI
* **ExpressJS** for API
* **Webpack** for client-side bundling
* **Redux** for state management
* **Sass** for styling
* **Jest** for unit testing
* **Cypress** for end-to-end testing
* Development and production modes
* Development mode has react and redux devtools extensions

Current known limitations/exclusions:
* Lack of a script to "set up" the starter
* For production mode, could use nginx to serve front-end files instead of having both UI and API on one ExpressJS server.
* Database service. This has been left out so far since I think that this is the most deployment-specific/opinionated aspect.

## Motivation
I found that the existing starters out there lacked one or more of the above listed aspects that I believe are necessary for a medium to large scale web application. I felt like it would be convenient if there was a starter that didn't compromise on detail.

## Setup
Find all occurances of "trew-component-starter" and replace with your desired service name.

## Scripts

### Prerequisites
* Ensure that the machine has **python** installed and is available on PATH. This is because of node-sass.
* `npm install` for node packages.

### Running the web application ("demo site")
* Development mode: `npm run start`
* Production mode, non-docker: `npm run build && node ./build/src/server/app.js`
* Production mode, docker: `npm run build-docker && npm run start-docker`

### Building just the component package
* Unbundled (most common usage): `npm run build-component`
  * The built component js files will be outputted to ./lib
* Bundled (i.e. minified main and vendor js, and css. Less common usage): `npm run bundle-component`
  * The bundled component js and css files will be outputted to ./lib/bundle

### Testing
* unit: `npm run test-unit`
* e2e (development mode): `npm run test-e2e-dev`
* e2e (production mode): `npm run test-e2e-prod`
* unit & e2e: `npm run test`
* Please see the other scripts in the package.json file for the complete list.

### Development
* The advised script to use while making changes is `npm run watch-all`. This concurrently starts the dev deployment and runs the unit tests, reloading both whenever changes occur.
